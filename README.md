## Enhancing DeCrypto: Finding Cryptocurrency Miners based on Periodic Behavior

DeCrypto has been proposed at the NordSec 2022 conference, you can find the article [here](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-22295-5_8).

More detailed description of network traffic classification based on periodicity can be found in [this article](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9964556).

Dataset CESNET-MINER22, mentioned in the presentation, is avaible on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/7189293). Our newly created dataset CESNET-MINER22-TS with periodicity features is available on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/8033351) as well. Data capture was performed by [ipfixprobe](https://github.com/CESNET/ipfixprobe).
